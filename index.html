    <h2>Personal Experience</h2>
    <p>
      Island Edge Experiences was created after years of observing a growing demand for curated,
      high-quality tourism services in Saint Lucia. With a background in hospitality operations and financial
      management, I recognized that many travelers seek premium experiences but often face fragmented
      booking systems and inconsistent service delivery.
      My goal was to build a tourism service that combines operational excellence with authentic Caribbean storytelling.
      Island Edge focuses on structure, quality partnerships, and seamless coordination so that guests
      enjoy their experience without logistical stress.

        “Island Edge designed our anniversary trip to Saint Lucia, and every detail was flawless—from VIP airport transfer
        to a private sunset cruise overlooking the Pitons. What impressed us most was the personalization.
        It felt exclusive, organized, and genuinely thoughtful.”
